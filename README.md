# Data Solution Problem 3
“Work in progress” script, where you need to add functionality to already existing program 

Add the following improvements: 

    - Select input & output folder with GUI, instead of hardcoding 

    - Remove empty columns when processing data 

    - Provide a combined single-sheet output, with extra column which will show where the data comes from (currently it’s one sheet = one sheet name = one asset type) 

    - Show before & after layers in GIS (can be QGIS or others)
